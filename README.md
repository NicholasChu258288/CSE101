  Assignment 1: Takes an input and output file, and alphabetically sorts the contents of the input file then placing it into the output file.
  
  Assignment 2: Takes a formatted input file then uses it to create a graph. It then, using the same input file finds a shortest path between specified edges and prints the adjacency representation of the graph along with the shortest paths to the outfile.
  
  Assignment 3: When given a formatted input file it uses it to create a graph. It then, uses DFS to find all the strongly connected components of a graph. The program then prints the adjacency representation of the graph along with the components to the outfile.
  
  Assignment 4: Uses a formatted input file then uses it to create two sparse matricies. Using these two matricies the program preforms various operations and prints all this out to a specified outfile.
  
  Assignment 5: Takes a maximum deck, creates a decks of individual cards up the specified size, then calculates the amount of perfect shuffles it would take to revert back to its original order, then prints the results.
  
  Assignment 6: Uses an input file of two large integers then preforms various calculations with these numbers.
